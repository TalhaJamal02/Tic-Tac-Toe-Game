# Tic Tac Toe Game
This project is a classic Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The core functionality is driven by JavaScript, handling game logic such as turn-based gameplay, win detection, and resetting the game. The design is kept simple with CSS, focusing primarily on the logic and functionality.
